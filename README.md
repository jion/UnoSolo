The SDL Senku Game

This is a game that I made a day that i'm boring of reorder the pieces from the board again and again. Feel free of use it, improve it, etc.
To compile, you need the SDL library v1.2 ( https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php ) and SDLImage 1.2 ( https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release-1.2.html )
